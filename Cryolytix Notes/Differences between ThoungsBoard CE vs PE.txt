Core Features (Shared)
Device Management: Both support unlimited devices—profiles, credentials (e.g., MQTT, HTTP).
Telemetry: Time-series data storage (Postgres in CE, Cassandra/Hybrid in PE)—key-value pairs (e.g., eye_temp).
Rule Engine: Customizable workflows—nodes for transformations (e.g., “Flatten Packet”), integrations.
Dashboards: Widgets (Time Series, Maps)—manual exports (CSV/PNG).
MQTT/HTTP/CoAP: Device connectivity—your teltonika/{imei}/from works in both.
Open-Source: CE is Apache 2.0—PE builds on it but adds proprietary features.
Key Differences
Feature	Community Edition (CE)	Professional Edition (PE)
License	Open-source (Apache 2.0)—free, modify freely	Commercial—subscription-based ($10-$1999/month)—source available, not fully open
Scalability	Single-node—~10k devices—manual clustering possible	Multi-node clustering—100k+ devices—load balancing, high availability
Database	PostgreSQL only (embedded or external)—timeseries in ts_kv	Hybrid (PostgreSQL + Cassandra/TimescaleDB)—optimized for massive timeseries
Timeseries Functions	Basic—store/query via ts_kv—no advanced aggregation (e.g., avg, min)—manual SQL	Advanced—aggregation (avg, sum, min/max), downsampling—built-in TimescaleDB support
White-Labeling	Manual—edit source (logo, colors)—no domain/email customization	Full—custom domain, logo, colors, email templates—UI rebranding out-of-box
Scheduled Reports	None—manual dashboard exports (CSV/PNG)	Yes—PDF/CSV reports—scheduled (daily/weekly)—email delivery
Advanced Widgets	Basic—Time Series, Tables, Maps—no clustering	Enhanced—marker clustering, advanced charts—better for 15,000 devices
Data Visualization	Limited—manual widget config—no advanced analytics	Richer—prebuilt analytics widgets—trend analysis, heatmaps
Rule Engine	Core nodes—transform, filter, external—custom scripts	Extra nodes—advanced analytics, scheduling, REST integrations—more prebuilt options
Multi-Tenancy	Basic—tenants/customers—manual user management	Enhanced—tenant profiles, rate limits—self-service for clients
Security	Basic—user roles, MQTT credentials—no SSO	Advanced—SSO (OAuth, SAML), 2FA, IP whitelisting—enterprise-grade
Device Provisioning	Manual—add devices via UI/API	Automated—bulk provisioning, OTA firmware updates—device groups
Performance	~500 msg/s single-node—tune Postgres for more	~10k+ msg/s—optimized DB, caching—scales horizontally
Backup/Restore	Manual—pg_dump Postgres	Built-in—scheduled backups, UI restore—disaster recovery
Support	Community—GitHub, forums	Commercial—24/7 support, SLAs—dedicated team
Cost	Free—self-hosted—your effort	$10/month (1 user) to $1999/month (unlimited)—cloud or self-hosted
